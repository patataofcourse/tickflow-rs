- parse the entirety of the document, with every kind of statement and directive
- pre-process directives (include/alias particularly)
- process file in order (statement by statement), add commands, labels and constants to the context
- final product can be directly compiled

todo:
    - how to get pointers to labels before everything is compiled
        - maybe resolve labels in a step after everything else is compiled?
